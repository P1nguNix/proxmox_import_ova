# Repository for a Proxmox Script

- This script is a student project where we had to export an ova file from `VirtualBox` then pushed it to a Proxmox Server and installing it.
- Download the repository `git clone https://github.com/P1nguNix/proxmox_import_ova.git`

  There's already a configuration in the script, if you want to adapt for your context, you have to modify PROXMOX_USER, PROXMOX_HOST and REMOTE_STORAGE_NAME.

  Enjoy !
